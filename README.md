# TDT13 - Harry Potter Text Generation

This repository contains the notebook for the actual generation of the Harry Potter text.

The training was performed on Kaggle. The "training"-notebook can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/skanin/harry-potter-text-generation). 

Unforunately, the model is too big for GitHub. To be able to generate your own Harry Potter text, run the ["training"-notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/skanin/harry-potter-text-generation), and copy the resulting output directory into this repo.
